      <h2>Pens Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Breeding Pen:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Obtain a breeding pair of spiders by killing spiders within the Lumbridge catacombs. Do this immediately at 64 Farming as this will be your main source of beans.</li>
            <li>Place these spiders in the breeding pen.</li>
            <li>If you have breeding yak or dragon, replace your spiders with those.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Small Pen:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Chinchompas (preferably red) in the small pens.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Medium Pen:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Move spiders that are bred into medium pens (do not place food in the medium pens until medium pen breeding is unlocked).</li>
            <li>Sell all bred spiders (preferably when adolescent).</li>
            <li>(Once medium pen breeding is unlocked, you can swap out 1 of your medium pens for a breeding pair of Zygomite (not gloomshroom). You do not need to feed them but can if you want.)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Large Pen:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Yaks > Dragons in large pens.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have obtained all of the listed shop unlocks, you should stop selling animals as adolescent and instead let them grow to elders (to maximize XP).</p>

      <h2>Note</h2>
      <p>If you get a Strawberry/Vanilla/Chocolate cow from Adam Antite, bank them. You will need them for the Contract Claws mystery.</p>
